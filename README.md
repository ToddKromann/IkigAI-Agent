# IkigAI-Agent

## Overview
IkigAI-Agent is a minimal viable product (MVP) designed to discover purpose for AI agents within the Autodidactic AI framework. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way for AI agents to understand their roles and responsibilities, aligning them with their "ikigai" or reason for being.

While the initial focus of IkigAI-Agent is on AI agents within the Autodidactic AI framework, we envision that the concepts and tools developed here could also be valuable for human agents and other AI systems in the future. By exploring the concept of "ikigai" in the context of AI, we aim to contribute to the broader conversation on AI ethics, alignment, and purpose-driven design.

## Features
- Discovering purpose: IkigAI-Agent helps AI agents identify their core purpose and align their actions accordingly.
- Framework integration: IkigAI-Agent is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Autodidactic AI framework.
- Scalable design: IkigAI-Agent is built with scalability in mind, allowing it to be extended to support more complex use cases in the future.
